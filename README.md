# Craft Files

An application for managing your design files. 

## What does this application do? 

This application allows you to view all your designs in a simple but efficient application. 

## How do I install it?

Download the latest release `.exe` and install it in Windows (other platforms following). Afterwards, start it and begin with the setup. 

## Setup

After starting the application, visit the settings from the button in the top left. This is the place where you can define all the folders the application is querying. 

All subfolders of these directories are now visible in the application. When clicking a card, the corresponding subfolder is opened in the windows explorer. 

If the subfolder contains a `bild.png` / `bild.jp[e]g` file, the application uses this image as a thumbnail.
This means that it is added to a database and therewith displayed on the website. 

If you add a `notiz.txt` to the subfolder, the containing text will be displayed below the folder title. 

## Who is this for? 

This application was made for managing design files of any type.
